/**
 This class provides the ability to animate types that conform to `Value` based on decay functions.

 The starting from `value`, the value will increase or decrease (depending on the `velocity` supplied) and will slow to a stop.
 This essentially provides the same "decaying" that `UIScrollView` does when you drag and let go. The animation is seeded with velocity, and that velocity decays over time.

 ```
 let decayAnimation = DecayAnimation<CGPoint>()
 decayAnimation.velocity = CGPoint(x: 2000.0, y: -2000.0)
 decayAnimation.onValueChanged { newValue in
    // Simulates scrolling a view.
    someView.bounds.origin = newValue
 }
 decayAnimation.start()
 ```

 - Note: This class is **not** thread-safe. It is meant to be run on the **main thread** only (much like any AppKit / UIKit operations should be main threaded).
