/**
 This class provides the ability to animate changes to values (`Value`) over time.

 The interesting part of this is the ability to have animations on the value performed simultaneously using `simd` registers.

 i.e. a `CGRect` that's animating will have all of its values animated simultaneously (vs. each value being animated sequentially), which should be more performant.

 This is normally accomplished by setting an initial state for the animation (`value`) and then setting a target (`toValue`) to animate to.

 This class, when ticked, will change a value and emit changes to that value via `onValueChanged`.
 If you wish to update the value manually, you may also do so via `updateValue(to:postValueChanged:)`.

 When resolved, this class will optionally call the `completionBlock`.

 - Note: The base implementation of this class is not meant to be used on its own, rather subclasses provided are to be used.
 - Note: This class is **not** thread-safe. It is meant to be run on the **main thread** only (much like any AppKit / UIKit operations should be main threaded).
 - SeeAlso: `BasicAnimation`, `DecayAnimation`, `SpringAnimation`.
